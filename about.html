                <li>
                    <b>EAT 5</b>: Eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables
                    <ul>
                        <li>Guidelines: The USDA sets a serving size for fruits and vegetables
            to be equal to about one-half cup. Greens like spinach and lettuce have a serving size equal to one full cup. In general, one serving of diced fruit or veggies is equal to one-half cup. A single piece of fruit, such as an apple or an orange, counts as one serving.</li>
                        <li>Permitted
                            <ul>
                                <li>One-half cup of applesauce may count as one serving but no
            more than two servings may count toward your daily total.</li>
                                <li>Four fluid ounces of store bought 100% fruit or vegetable juice
            may count as one serving but no more than two servings may count toward your daily total. If you are juicing from home, up to three servings from juicing may count toward your daily total.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Tips: Many nutrition and dietary experts suggest you eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables every day, depending on your age, gender, and level of physical activity. Eating a variety is most beneficial. Fruits and veggies may be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried, and may be whole, cut-up, or pureed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>This is not a weight loss competition – it is a whole-health challenge where everyone has the opportunity to win prizes for earning enough points. If you would like to lose weight and personally track it then you also have the opportunity to win more prizes.</li>
                <li>Prizes will be available as Amazon, Target, Great Escape (movies), or Red Robin gift cards, or as cash added to your paycheck.</li>
                <li>You must report your weekly results to Barbie Strong no later than 10:00am every Thursday morning. Failure to report will forfeit your participation in the competition.</li>
                <li>If you hope to be eligible to participate in the Platinum Plus and Platinum medal rounds (weight loss) then you must track your weight from the beginning and report your loss percentage weekly.</li>
                <li>Definition of "maintaining weight loss". . . If you are eligible to compete for Platinum Plus or Platinum medals (10% or 5 - 9.99% weight loss on April 17), then on October 17 you must weigh equal to or less than your weight recorded on April 17 to win one of those medals. If you gained some weight back, but were still above 5% weight loss you will NOT earn a bonus medal - for example: On April 17 your weight loss was 11% but by October 17 you gained a few pounds back and your total weight loss was now 9.5% – you do NOT win any of the bonus medals.</li>
                <li>For those that have not participated before here is some more info on the "1 point per day, maximum 5 points per week" for each category. You need to record each category all seven days per week, but the maximum points you earn for each category in a week is 5 points. That means you can go off your "training regimen" 2 days a week and still get a perfect score – whether you blow everything off on the same two days or not, you basically have two freebies in each category throughout each week.</li>
                <li>So remember to let us know if you are participating by Wednesday noon. Then start tracking your healthy categories on Thursday and every day thereafter. If you plan to participate in the weight loss bonus medal rounds, then you need to weigh-in first thing Thursday morning and record that on your personal tracking spreadsheet.</li>
